# CityWatch

CityWatch is a Django web application for submitting, tracking, and analyzing community reports.

## Local Development

### Requirements

- Python 3.12 or newer
- Git
- A terminal opened in the project root

### 1. Open the project folder

PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Meia\citywatch
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If PowerShell blocks activation, run this once for the current terminal:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Then activate again:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install Django

This project currently does not include a `requirements.txt` file.

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install django
```

### 4. Apply database migrations

```powershell
python manage.py migrate
```

The local SQLite database is `db.sqlite3` in the project root. Do not delete it if you need the existing local data.

### 5. Check the project

```powershell
python manage.py check
```

### 6. Run the automated tests

```powershell
python manage.py test
```

Some apps currently have limited test coverage, but this command checks all Django app tests.

### 7. Start the local server

```powershell
python manage.py runserver
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal, normally:

- http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- http://localhost:8000/

Leave the server terminal running while testing. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

## Local Test Flow

1. Open the landing page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
2. Open the registration page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/register/.
3. Create a resident account with a unique username and email.
4. Open the login page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/.
5. Log in with the new account and verify that the resident dashboard opens.
6. Test invalid login details and mismatched registration passwords.
7. After changing a template, refresh the browser with `Ctrl+Shift+R`.
8. If a route behaves unexpectedly, check the Django server terminal for errors.

## Frontend Template Paths

The templates are stored inside each Django app. These are the main UI files:

### Authentication and account UI

- `accounts/templates/accounts/landing.html` - public landing page
- `accounts/templates/accounts/login.html` - **login UI**
- `accounts/templates/accounts/register.html` - **registration UI**
- `accounts/templates/accounts/profile.html` - user profile UI
- `accounts/templates/accounts/user_list.html` - staff user management UI

Routes:

- `/` - landing page
- `/accounts/login/` - login
- `/accounts/register/` - registration
- `/accounts/profile/` - profile
- `/accounts/users/` - staff user list

### Reports UI

- `reports/templates/reports/home.html`
- `reports/templates/reports/dashboard.html`
- `reports/templates/reports/report_list.html`
- `reports/templates/reports/report_detail.html`
- `reports/templates/reports/report_form.html`
- `reports/templates/reports/report_confirm_delete.html`
- `reports/templates/reports/public_board.html`
- `reports/templates/reports/admin_report_list.html`
- `reports/templates/reports/admin_report_detail.html`
- `reports/templates/reports/announcements.html`

### Analytics UI

- `analytics/templates/analytics/dashboard.html`
- `analytics/templates/analytics/map_view.html`
- `analytics/templates/analytics/reports_analytics.html`

### Assignments UI

- `assignments/templates/assignments/department_list.html`

## Useful Commands

```powershell
# Check for Django configuration problems
python manage.py check

# Run tests
python manage.py test

# Run one app's tests
python manage.py test accounts
python manage.py test reports

# Create migrations after changing models
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create an admin account for /admin/
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Git Workflow

Check the current state before committing:

```powershell
git status
git diff
```

Commit and push source/template changes:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push origin main
```

Avoid committing local Python cache files or accidental database changes unless they are intentionally part of the change.
